## Project Description
This project focuses on unsupervised learning techniques applied to a dataset containing information about penguins native to Antarctica. By utilizing machine learning algorithms such as K-means clustering, the project aims to uncover hidden patterns and clusters within the dataset.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

## Dataset Configuration
- Culmen Length (mm)
- Culmen Depth (mm)
- Flipper Length (mm)
- Body Mass (g)
- Sex (Male/Female)

Although the species of penguins were not recorded, it is known that there are three species native to the region: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. The project aims to identify clusters within the dataset that may correspond to these species.

## Project Steps
1. Loading and examining the dataset
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature extraction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
4. Applying K-means clustering algorithm
5. Analyzing and visualizing the clusters
6. Evaluating the results and drawing insights

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset `penguins.csv`
- `Arctic_Penguin_Exploration.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and analysis
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project and its objectives

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
